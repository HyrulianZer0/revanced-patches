Auto hide chats/remove

I listen to alot of music streams on youtube, some even have chats ... Filled with bots and toxic people

I presume the setting would be in the revanced tab / auto hide chats / on / off

If you want a lengthy explanation, i cant give you one

Its a simple feature request to remove or hide the chats permanently 

I dont know the code but i hope this will be a simple feature and would be applied soon ...

Kind regards
